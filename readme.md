# FinditCheap

I wanted to be able to find the best deals on things, so I created a webscraping tool for it :-)

# Idea

Give the app a list of items that we want
Give tha app a list of places to scrape 
Compare the prices for each of the items and record the best price
Upload this data to a 
Email a group of users for price notifications daily
